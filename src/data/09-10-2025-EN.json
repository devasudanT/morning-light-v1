    "content": "As we continue our study on the selection of priests, today we look at another specific condition mentioned in Leviticus 21:20; a priest “who has a blemish in his eye.” The law makes a clear distinction between one who is blind and one who merely has a defect in his eye. In the first case, there is no sight at all, but in the second, the priest can see; though not clearly. The Hebrew phrase used here is mum b’eino, meaning “a blemish or fault in his eye.” The word mum refers to a visible imperfection; something that affects how light enters and is perceived by the eye.\n\nThis meant that the priest’s eye, though present, was impaired; not blind, but clouded, blurred, or distorted. In ancient understanding, several types of eye defects could fall into this category.\nSome might have suffered from **cataracts**, where the eye became cloudy or opaque, allowing light but not clear vision. Others may have had **corneal scars or white spots** caused by injury or infection, distorting the way they saw objects. Some could have had **crossed eyes (strabismus)**, with one eye focusing forward and the other slightly aside; symbolizing lack of single focus. Others may have had **unequal pupils, bulging eyes, or discoloration**, all visible blemishes. Still others may have experienced **partial blindness or tunnel vision**, seeing shapes or movement but missing full detail.\n\nThese defects, while not moral failings, carried both symbolic and practical importance. The priest’s eyes had to be clear and steady because his duties depended heavily on perception. He inspected animals for blemishes, read and interpreted the Law, and discerned between clean and unclean. His role required careful observation of sacrifices, garments, and temple vessels - tasks demanding sharp, undistorted sight. A blemish in the eye could cause him to misjudge an offering, misread a command, or spill sacred blood in error.\n\nYahweh’s command, therefore, was not an act of rejection but of protection; both for His holiness and for the priest himself. The sanctuary demanded perfection in symbol, and a single mistake in the holy place could bring severe consequences, even death. By restricting such priests from altar service, God demonstrated both His holiness and His compassion. He ensured that no priest would suffer harm due to his impairment, and no offering would be marred by human limitation.\n\nThis law once again reminds us of Yahweh’s perfect balance of holiness and love. Every command He gave to Israel, even those concerning physical blemishes, carried meaning; not to exclude, but to preserve, to protect, and to point forward to the flawless priesthood of the One who would come, perfect in sight, judgment, and discernment."

    "content": "In the New Creation life, the priest with a blemish in his eye represents a person who has spiritual sight, yet that sight is blurred. This is not a person completely blind to truth; they see, but not clearly. They know there is one Almighty God, Yahweh, and yet their understanding is clouded by tradition or human interpretation. They can read the Bible and even teach parts of it, yet their vision of the truth is distorted. They see the path but walk uncertainly upon it; they hear the Word but filter it through custom or emotion. It is a condition of partial sight; spiritual impairment that allows light to enter, but not enough to bring full clarity.\n\nA defective eye symbolizes a life where the vision of God’s truth is dimmed. Such a person understands portions of Scripture but fails to see the wholeness of God’s plan. Their discernment becomes uneven; sometimes clear, sometimes confused. They may call sin by softer names or justify actions that God condemns. Their moral vision bends to the pressure of the world, instead of staying fixed on Christ. Messiah described such leaders as “blind guides” in Matthew 23:24, who strain at small matters but swallow great errors. Even though their eyes are open, they do not truly perceive.\n\nThis image carries deep parallels between the physical and spiritual. A cataract in the natural eye clouds the lens; light enters, but vision is dim. Spiritually, this is the person who cannot see God’s full purpose because their spiritual lens is clouded with pride, self-interest, or confusion. Ephesians 1:18 reminds us that “the eyes of your understanding” must be enlightened; meaning that the Spirit must clear away the cloud. Crossed eyes, or strabismus, depict divided focus; one eye on God and another on the world. Jesus said plainly, “No man can serve two masters” (Matthew 6:24). When the vision is divided, the life becomes unstable and directionless.\n\nCorneal scars, left by past injury, reflect the distortions caused by unresolved hurt or bitterness. Hebrews 12:15 warns that “a root of bitterness” can spring up and defile many. Just as scars on the eye bend light wrongly, emotional wounds can twist our perception of others, of truth, and even of God’s love. Partial blindness mirrors selective obedience; seeing only the verses that comfort, while ignoring those that convict. In John 9:41, Jesus rebuked the Pharisees: “If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.” They claimed sight but refused light.\n\nYahweh’s command that such a priest could not serve at the altar teaches us a vital truth: His service requires clear sight. The priest stood as a reflection of His perfection, and any distortion in sight would misrepresent His holiness. Christ, our perfect High Priest, is described in Revelation 1:14 as having “eyes like a flame of fire” - eyes that penetrate, discern, and reveal truth without error. He is the standard of perfect sight.\n\nEvery believer today stands in priestly calling before God (1 Peter 2:5), and so this law speaks directly to us. “The light of the body is the eye,” Jesus said in Matthew 6:22. “When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light.” A “single eye” means focused devotion - one direction, one purpose, one truth. It is to live with an undivided heart, seeing as God sees. To have such an eye is to walk in clarity, moral purity, and unwavering discernment.\n\nBut a “defective eye” in the spiritual sense shows when we read the Word but do not obey it, when we see the faults of others but overlook our own\n\n(Matthew 7:-5), or when we serve God outwardly, but our hearts remain clouded within. It is when tradition blinds the truth, or when emotion clouds faith. Such eyes can still see light, but not enough to walk straight.\nTherefore, this lesson is both a warning and an invitation. Yahweh calls His priests - His people - to see clearly, to discern rightly, and to keep their spiritual vision pure. For only those whose eyes are single toward Him will walk in the fullness of light, truth, and divine purpose.\n\nHow can this impaired eye be healed? We will explore this in detail in tomorrow’s Morning Light."
