    "content": "Today we will continue our study on the selection of priests. In Leviticus 21, the law states that a man who is disfigured or deformed could not serve at the altar. Some translations even describe this as a “flat nose.” The priest’s work involved handling incense, sacrifices, and holy food. If his nose was disfigured, crushed, or flat, it was understood in ancient culture as a sign of impaired health, possible breathing difficulty, or facial deformity. Since the priest represented God’s dignity and wholeness before the people, such a condition was seen as unsuitable for the holy service.\n\nIn the world of the ancient Near East, a mutilated or flattened nose often carried associations of shame. Assyrian and Babylonian records tell us that enemies or criminals sometimes had their noses cut off or crushed as a form of humiliation and punishment. If a priest bore such a mark and stood before the altar, it could symbolize disgrace, clashing with the sacred atmosphere God required. The altar was a place where everything reflected perfection, order, and holiness.\n\nA disfigured appearance would have disrupted that picture, distracting the worshippers from God’s glory.\n\nThe symbolism of the nose reaches deeper in Hebrew thought. The Hebrew words **aph** and **ruach** are connected with breath and even the expression of life and emotion. A damaged or deformed nose represented more than a physical issue; it suggested impaired breath, and therefore impaired life. The priest, as one who stood before God, symbolized spiritual vitality and the “breath of life” given to man. If his nose was crushed or missing, it presented an incomplete image of that life, and the symbol of wholeness in God’s service was broken.\n\nThe law also mentioned those who were deformed or not fully formed in body. The tasks of a priest required strength, balance, and precision. Carrying sacrificial animals, lifting portions onto the altar, handling fire, and sprinkling blood demanded steady hands and strong bodies. A crippled limb, a missing hand or foot, or abnormal growth would limit the priest’s ability to serve safely and accurately. Around the altar, nothing careless or clumsy was allowed, for the service pictured God’s exactness and perfection.\n\nIn the culture of the time, physical wholeness was associated with dignity and honor. To the people, a visibly deformed priest could be seen as shameful, and their eyes would be drawn to the imperfection instead of to God’s holiness. The priest was a mediator between God and Israel, standing as a visible reminder of divine order. If his body bore a serious deformity, it risked distorting the picture of God’s perfection and shifting attention away from Yahweh to the man’s condition.\n\nThus, these restrictions were not judgments on worth or value, but safeguards for the holiness of the service. The priests were chosen to reflect wholeness before the altar, so that the people’s focus would remain on the God of Israel, who is perfect and without defect.\n"

    "content": "Leviticus 21 reminds us that a priest with a disfigured or flat nose could not minister at the altar. While at first this may sound unusual, Scripture shows us that the nose carried deep meaning, both physically and spiritually.\n\nTo understand this, we need to look at what the nose symbolized in the Hebrew mind: breath and discernment.\nThe nose is where breath enters. From the very beginning of creation, it was through the nostrils that life was given. “The LORD God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul” (Genesis 2:7). Our first breath was not merely air, but Life from God, making us living beings. Later, when judgment fell during the flood, it was said, “All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was in the dry land, died” (Genesis 7:22). The nostrils became the mark of whether life was present or absent. For a priest to have a whole and uninjured nose pictured the idea of fullness of life; an unbroken connection with God. But a crushed or missing nose represented something broken in that connection, a picture of impaired life.\n\nThe Hebrew language adds another layer. The word aph, meaning “nose,” is also used to describe passion, anger, or perception. In this way, the nose is not only about breath but also about discernment and spiritual sensing. Just as our natural nose can detect what is clean or foul, the spiritual “nose” represents the ability to sense what is holy and what is corrupt. Isaiah prophesied of Messiah in this way: “His delight is in the fear of Yahweh, and He shall not judge by the sight of His eyes, nor decide by the hearing of His ears” (Isaiah 11:3). The word “delight” here literally means “smelling” in Hebrew. Messiah would not depend on sight or hearing alone, but on the Spirit’s deep discernment; a holy sense of smell that could perceive truth beyond appearances. A whole nose in a priest symbolized that same discernment.\n\nA deformed or flat nose, by contrast, pictured the loss of sensitivity, an inability to discern between truth and error, between holy and profane.\nIf the nose is tied to breath, then a crushed nose symbolized the loss of the breath of life. Spiritually, sin suffocates us. When we are cut off from God’s Spirit, we lose vitality, and our testimony becomes lifeless. Jesus Himself said, “Let the dead bury their dead” (Luke 9:60). Without God’s breath, people may still move and function outwardly, but they are spiritually dead. A priest with a disfigured nose became a living picture of this condition. Instead of standing at the altar full of the breath of life, he stood as one who seemed cut off.\n\nBut there is also another dimension. The nose, as the place of discernment, determines whether something is pleasant or foul. Spiritually, when the “nose” is disfigured, it loses this sensitivity. It cannot properly distinguish between what pleases God and what defiles Him. Paul tells us that “we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing” (2 Corinthians 2:15). When our spiritual senses are whole, we recognize and appreciate the sweet fragrance of Christ’s sacrifice; the offering of Himself to God as “a pleasing aroma” (Ephesians 5:2). But when our nose is deformed, we lose this sensitivity. We no longer value His sacrifice as precious. Instead of drawing closer to Christ, we begin to drift away from Him, away from His body, and finally away from the truth.\nWhat causes this loss of sensitivity? Every form of sin, every lust of the world, is like an injury to our spiritual nose. Over time, repeated blows dull our ability to discern. That is why even consecrated brethren, who once walked faithfully, sometimes drift back toward the world. It is not always a sudden fall, but often the slow loss of appreciation for Christ’s sacrifice; the losing of sensitivity to His fragrance - that leads to wandering. Once the sweetness of Christ’s offering is no longer treasured, other voices and other attractions take its place.\n\nThis is why the law barred priests with disfigured noses from altar service.\n\nThe message was not that the man himself was rejected, for he was still part of the priestly household and permitted to eat the holy food (Leviticus 21:22). Instead, the message was symbolic: a priest standing at God’s altar had to represent life, discernment, and holiness. A disfigured nose painted the opposite picture; broken breath, lost discernment, and dulled sensitivity to the sacrifice of Christ. Such a man could not stand as the visible symbol of God’s perfection.\nThe picture speaks powerfully to us. If our nose represents breath, then when we grieve or quench the Spirit (Ephesians 4:30; 1 Thessalonians 5:19), we cut off that breath. If the nose represents discernment, then when our spiritual senses are dulled, we cannot tell holy from unholy, truth from falsehood. And if the nose represents sensitivity to Christ’s offering, then when it is disfigured, we no longer prize His sacrifice as the most beautiful aroma before God. We risk drifting into worldliness, because we no longer sense the sweetness of His love.\nThink of how vital this is for those who serve. A priest without discernment could not recognize what was clean or unclean. A person without discernment cannot test doctrine, cannot avoid deception, cannot guide others into truth.\n\nA priest without breath could not carry the fire or incense properly. A person without the Spirit’s breath cannot worship with life, cannot pray with power, cannot bear witness with strength. A priest with a damaged nose could not symbolize holiness before the people. And a person who has lost sensitivity to Christ’s fragrance cannot walk in holiness or lead others to Him.\nThus, the law of Leviticus is not harsh but wise. It safeguarded the holy picture that priesthood was meant to display. It also teaches us that breath, discernment, and sensitivity to Christ’s sacrifice are not optional extras, but essential marks of priesthood. To serve at the altar; whether in the Old Covenant with sacrifices or in the New Covenant with spiritual offerings - one must be alive with the breath of God, alert with discernment, and deeply appreciative of the pleasing sacrifice of Christ. Without these, ministry becomes hollow, distorted, and false.\n\nThis is why God set the rule. The nose equals breath, discernment, and sensitivity to Christ’s sacrifice. A disfigured nose equals lost life, lost discernment, and dulled appreciation for Christ’s fragrant offering.\n\nSuch a priest could not minister, not because he lacked value as a person, but because the picture of God’s holiness had to remain whole. And so, it is with us: priesthood requires the breath of the Spirit, clarity in discernment, and the living appreciation of Christ’s offering. Anything less is a broken picture of the truth."
